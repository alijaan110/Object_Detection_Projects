Object Detection project using YOLOv5
Project Overview:
By using YOLOv5 pre-trained object detection model, project for road scenarios. The project's primary objective is to develop an accurate and robust model capable of detecting four crucial road scenarios: "Left Turn," "Right Turn," "Straight," and "Unexpected Road."
Challenges in Road Scenarios:
Mention the unique challenges and complexities associated with road scenarios. Explain how factors such as varying road conditions, traffic situations, and weather conditions pose challenges for automated systems.

Dataset collected from KaraKuram Highway which includes four classes and in each class  there are thirty images which are annotated by using “LABELIMG”.
Classes: Emphasize that the dataset comprises four distinct classes, each representing a specific road scenario.
"Left Turn": Images and instances involving left turns.
"Right Turn": Images and instances involving right turns.
"Straight": Images and instances capturing straight road situations.
"Unexpected Road": Images and instances depicting unexpected or challenging road conditions.
